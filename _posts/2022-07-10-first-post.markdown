I'm starting this website hosted on Github to serve as my porfolio and blog. Through this site, I would like to share my thoughts and opinions on the topics of Game Development and Blockchain Games.

I have no experience in building a website. Although I could have gone through the route of using Wix or Wordpress, I thought that using Github Pages as my main blog would be a fun idea and would fit my profile as a programmer. I'm hoping to learn Jekyll along the way and improve this site.

See you around!

Hi guys! 


To introduce myself, I have been programming games since 2002. I am currently the Engineering Director and Co-Founder of [Altitude Games](https://www.altitude-games.com/). We specialize in developing mobile games using the Unity game engine. We're also exploring the new opportunities in blockchain games. 

My full resume is [here](/resume).
